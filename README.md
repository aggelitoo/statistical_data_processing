Welcome to my homework repo for the course statistical data processing, given at Stockholm University fall 2022!

**Most noteworthy:** \
The final project in this course yielded me [this](https://github.com/aggelitoo/statistical_data_processing/blob/master/BestPresentationAward-2023-01-12_signed.pdf) award, for my "The right Spotify playlist for the occasion", which used the valence/arousal model for emotions in combination with Spotify track metrics in order to generate playlists based on an emotion.
